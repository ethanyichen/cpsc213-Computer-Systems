01 02 03 04 big endian: 16909060
	    little endian: 67305985
04 03 02 01 little endian : 16909060
	    big endian: 67305985
Test passed
Simple test to ensure  that the function perform little endian and big endian correctly
The big endian value we get by running 01 02 03 04 should be the same when we run 04 03 02 01 and get the little endian value

80 01 02 03
Big endian: -2147417597
Little endian: 50463104
The negative test should successfully give us negative number as the big endian result when running the program
