Convert the two decimal numbers to hex
D: -2,256,461 to hex(4 byte); 0xFFDD91B3
RA: 521829 to hex: 0x0007F665
It is wrong as the Hubble data set is using big endian while we are using intel's little endian to evaluate it.
To get the correct answer, we will change these bytes to little endian.
D : 0xB391DDFF in decimal -1282286081
RA: 0x65F60700 in decimal 1710622464 
search for the decimals above instead
