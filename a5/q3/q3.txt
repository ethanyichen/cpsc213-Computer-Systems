The program has a bug of dangling pointer. Because when we pass in the pointers on the list that have all the user inputs to the tree, the tree will add these pointers as the nodes. But then in the main.c, the program delete all its element pointers and element -> value. That makes all the element pointers and element->value pointers pointing to the freed memory, causing dangling pointers.
